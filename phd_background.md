# Terms to Understand

* [ ] UneXt MLP to model the representation
* [ ] Tokenized MLP block
* [ ] UneXt shifting the channels
* [ ] UneXt axial shift
* [ ] Bilinear interpolation instead of transpose conv, since transpose is basicaly a interpolation but learnable, which makes it slow
* [ ] UneXt embedding dimension == number of tokens
* [ ] DWConv
* [ ] UneXt Normalize along the tokens instead of normalizing across the batch, in tokenized mlp blocks
