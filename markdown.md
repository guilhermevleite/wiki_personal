# Github Markdown

Ignore markdown by placing a \ before the markdown symbol: \*\*Not Bold\*\*.  

## - Syntax:
'''python
def test(param)
    # Identation need to be four spaces
    print("Hell on earth!")
    var status = 666
'''

Task list:
- [x] @mentions, #refs, [links](), **formatting**, and <del>tags</del> supported
- [x] list syntax required (any unordered or ordered list supported)
